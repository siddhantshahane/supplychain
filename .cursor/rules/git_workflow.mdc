# Git Workflow Rules

## Branch Strategy

### Main Branches
1. `main` - Production-ready code
2. `develop` - Integration branch for features
3. `staging` - Pre-production testing

### Feature Branches
1. Branch naming: `feature/description`
2. Create from `develop`
3. Keep focused and small
4. Regular updates from `develop`
5. Delete after merging

### Hotfix Branches
1. Branch naming: `hotfix/description`
2. Create from `main`
3. Merge back to both `main` and `develop`
4. Delete after merging

### Release Branches
1. Branch naming: `release/version`
2. Create from `develop`
3. Only bug fixes and documentation
4. Merge to both `main` and `develop`
5. Tag with version number

## Commit Guidelines

### Commit Messages
1. Use present tense
2. Start with a verb
3. Keep first line under 50 chars
4. Add detailed description if needed
5. Reference issue numbers

### Commit Structure
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types
- feat: New feature
- fix: Bug fix
- docs: Documentation
- style: Formatting
- refactor: Code restructuring
- test: Adding tests
- chore: Maintenance

## Pull Request Process

### Creating PRs
1. Clear title and description
2. Reference related issues
3. List changes made
4. Add screenshots if UI changes
5. Request reviews from team members

### Review Process
1. At least one approval required
2. All tests must pass
3. No merge conflicts
4. Follow coding standards
5. Documentation updated

### Merging
1. Squash and merge for features
2. Merge commit for releases
3. Delete branch after merge
4. Update version numbers
5. Tag releases

## Version Control

### Version Numbers
1. Follow semantic versioning
2. Major.Minor.Patch format
3. Update in appropriate files
4. Tag releases in Git
5. Document changes

### Release Process
1. Create release branch
2. Update version numbers
3. Update changelog
4. Create pull request
5. Deploy to staging

## Collaboration

### Team Workflow
1. Regular pulls from develop
2. Resolve conflicts locally
3. Communicate changes
4. Help review others' code
5. Keep discussions in PRs

### Code Review
1. Be constructive
2. Check functionality
3. Verify tests
4. Look for security issues

## Git Configuration

### Local Setup
1. Configure user details
2. Set up SSH keys
